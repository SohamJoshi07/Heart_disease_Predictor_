# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various medical and health-related parameters, the model helps in identifying individuals who may be at risk of heart disease. The complete implementation is done in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and follows a standard machine learning pipeline.
