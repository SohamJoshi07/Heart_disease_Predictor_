🧠 Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can significantly reduce the risk of severe complications. This project aims to use historical patient data to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various health parameters.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains multiple medical features such as:
Age
Sex
Chest pain type
Resting blood pressure
Cholesterol level
Fasting blood sugar
Maximum heart rate achieved
Other relevant clinical attributes
The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Scikit-learn

🔄 Workflow

Data Loading & Exploration
Understanding the structure and distribution of the dataset.

Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.

Model Building
Training machine learning models for heart disease prediction.

Model Evaluation
Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

📈 Results & Insights

The trained models are capable of predicting heart disease with good accuracy.
Feature analysis helps identify key medical parameters influencing heart disease risk.
The project demonstrates how machine learning can support healthcare analytics.
